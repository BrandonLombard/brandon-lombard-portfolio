    <p>
        BOLDFlash, a producer of flash memory components, is facing fragmented communication within its Mobile Division
        Units.
        These challenges have disrupted internal operations, delayed product delivery, and caused frustration among
        departments,
        ultimately leading to customer dissatisfaction. This document will outline identified problems within the
        company and
        how communication can be improved to correct these issues.

    </p>
    <h3>Background and Area of Focus</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    One critical issue within BOLDFlash involves their confusing product documentation that has unclear and incomplete
    instructions, overly technical terminology, a disorganized structure, and a lack of visuals or examples. For
    example, in
    Step 3 of the BOLDFlash Flash Drive Product #A23-B Installation Instructions, it states “to finish – it will go
    through
    a couple of more screens and you might need to click OK a few times.” This provides no clear guidance for the user,
    as
    the instructions do not identify what the screens will say or look like. Additionally, BOLDFlash is using a revised
    Research and Development product release process, where they no longer respond to questions coming from Tech Support
    prior to the actual product release date, therefore increasing the lack of information exchange.
    </p>
    There are additional issues between Sales and Manufacturing, where Sales commits to delivery schedules without
    consulting Manufacturing. Additionally, if no response is received within two business days, Sales will assume
    approval
    which causes unmet deadlines and operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, there is a lack of defined roles between
    Marketing and Product Development. Marketing struggles to provide accurate market projections where Product
    Development
    suggests new products without consulting with Marketing on market trends. This lack of communication creates
    unrealistic
    expectations and can strain the relationship between the two departments.
    <p>
        The most important area to fix initially is the product documentation, since it directly impacts internal
        operations and
        customer satisfaction. Concise documentation is the foundation for effective technical communication between
        both
        departments and the end users, as it makes it easier for customers to understand how to use the product, and for
        technical support to successfully assist customers when they are having trouble using the product. Additionally,
        improved documentation enables Technical Support to provide faster and more accurate assistance, minimizing
        delays and
        confusion while assisting customers. Addressing this issue not only strengthens interdepartmental communication
        but also
        builds trust among customers, making it an important starting point.
    </p>

    <h3>Planning and Communication with Stakeholders</h3>
    <b>Key Stakeholders</b>
    <p>
        The key stakeholders involved in the product documentation issue include the end users, the Technical Support
        team, and
        the Research and Development team. Most important are the end users, as they require accurate and easy to
        understand
        instructions to use BOLDFlash’s products. Confusing documentation will negatively impact their experience and
        perception
        of the brand, while increasing the workload of the Technical Support team, as the team will need to take more
        time
        assisting customers due to the poor documentation. The Technical Support team are also key stakeholders as they
        frequently use the product documentation to assist end users. Finally, the Research and Development team is a
        key
        stakeholder as they are responsible for creating the initial product documentation. It is essential that the
        Research
        and Development team develops comprehensive and concise documentation, as there is a trickle-down effect, and it
        can
        negatively impact multiple other key stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        To properly address these groups, we will use the “Know Your Audience” communication framework, based on
        Deloitte’s
        Business Chemistry model, for both planning and communicating with stakeholders in the product documentation
        issue. This
        framework involves tailoring communication to fit the unique needs of different audience types (Noah L., 2023).
        For
        example, the Research and Development team is composed of “Guardians” and “Drivers”, who prefer methodical and
        detail-oriented communication, emphasizing measurable outcomes. In contrast, Technical Support, which includes
        “Integrators”, will benefit from a focus on collaboration and the practical application of solutions that
        consider user
        needs. Finally, end users likely spanning various types, will need simplified, high-level communication that
        prioritizes
        clarity and usability.
    </p>

    <b>Established Practices</b>
    <p>
        To address the product documentation issue, BOLDFlash can implement several established communication practices
        to
        improve collaboration and ensure the needs of stakeholders are met. First, we will establish regular
        collaboration
        meetings between Research and Development and Technical Support leadership. This way, the two groups may discuss
        the
        product documentation and what must be improved before the final version is released. Then, we can implement
        feedback
        loops between the end users and Technical Support. Feedback loops, which are cyclical processes where
        information is
        continuously exchanged and refined, help identify shortcomings and ensure documentation evolves to meet user
        needs
        (Trilling, 2024). By using online forms and feedback sessions between end users and members of the Technical
        Support
        team, BOLDFlash can obtain suggestions and common challenges that the users are facing. Finally, we will
        implement
        transparent communication channels by using project management tools (i.e. Slack and Basecamp) to keep key
        stakeholders
        informed about documentation updates, timelines, and versions. By implementing this framework, communication
        will foster
        collaboration and alignment between stakeholders and improve the end user’s experience with BOLDFlash products.

    </p>
    <h3>Planning and Communication With Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>
        The Mobile Division at BOLDFlash, a producer of flash memory components, is encountering communication and
        collaboration
        issues which is causing a negative impact on its operations, product development process, and team morale. These
        challenges range from poorly written documentation, to lack of clear communication channels, and lack of
        collaboration
        across these teams. This training plan and communication framework introduces better communication strategies
        and
        training methods to address these issues and concerns within BOLDFlash.
    </p>
    <b>Communication Strategies</b>
    <p>
        To effectively train the Mobile Division teams, various methods of communication will be used to ensure smooth
        dissemination of information. Since they are experiencing communication issues across all functional teams, even
        with
        Quarterly cross-functional meetings, more frequent training cross-departmental meetings with clearly defined
        expectations must be implemented. Before every meeting, a meeting agenda will be written that has key discussion
        points
        for each department and will be disseminated via email prior to the meeting. This is because regular meetings
        and
        well-structured presentations that are supported by clear and concise communication with actionable outcomes are
        essential for building strong relationships and fostering successful stakeholder engagement (Lenarčič & Faganel,
        2024,
        p. 382). To maximize the effectiveness of these meetings, they will be recorded, and a written summary will
        highlight
        key points of the training for future reference, or if some employees miss the training. A project manager will
        then
        assign tasks to specific team members or departments to ensure timely resolution of identified issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, to address ongoing documentation issues between Research and Development and Technical Support,
        virtual
        training will be created to teach these teams how documentation should be created and read, which will be
        assigned to
        each team member by the project manager. Then, regular training sessions will be conducted between the two teams
        so they
        can discuss any new documentation that is created and make sure each team member understands any new
        documentation
        standards. To avoid overloading communication channels, email will be reserved for quick questions and immediate
        needs,
        while project management tools will be used to streamline communication. This will reduce clutter and ensure
        that
        important messages are not overlooked.
    </p>
    <b>Collaboration Strategies</b>
    <p>Collaboration is crucial for improving communication and teamwork issues within the Mobile Division. Misalignment
        between departments such as Marketing, Manufacturing, R&D, and Sales has led to inefficiencies, unmet deadlines,
        and
        frustrated employees. To improve collaboration, a structured approach will be used so that the teams are aligned
        and
        working towards their goals together. First, a Project Management Office (PMO) will be implemented in the Mobile
        Division to act as a bridge between the departments and facilitate cross-departmental collaboration. A PMO plays
        a
        critical role in aligning different teams by promoting consistency, improving project outcomes, and fostering a
        culture
        of collaboration (Gale, 2016). The PMO will take charge of managing deadlines, tasks, and holding each
        department
        accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another challenge being faced involves the Sales team’s lack of collaboration with Manufacturing. In one case,
        the Sales
        team committed to selling more chips than manufacturing was able to produce, and when confronted about it, they
        were
        told to do it anyway. This resulted in a system overload crash with the system’s software which caused the plant
        to be
        closed for a day while waiting for engineering to fix it (Beer, & Shelton, 2012). To fix this, a sales and
        manufacturing
        approval system will be implemented using project management software to resolve existing miscommunication. This
        way,
        all teams can have real-time visibility into production ability, customer needs, and project deadlines, which
        will align
        the two departments. Finally, Research and Development alongside technical Support will use a collaborative
        review
        process for developing their product documentation. When new documentation is produced, both teams will meet to
        review
        it for accuracy and conciseness. These collaboration strategies will help to address the unique needs or various
        departments and promote cross-departmental collaboration.
    </p>

    <b>Training Methods</b>
    <p>
        To deliver effective training for the Mobile Division teams, we will use multiple methods, tailored to specific
        audiences to ensure the training is engaging and relevant. Since BOLDFlash needs more frequent and organized
        training
        meetings, they will have departmental team check-in meetings every week, while holding the cross-functional
        meetings
        monthly, which can be held in the corporate headquarters. For more specialized or hands-on training, such as
        Manufacturing and Technical Support teams, there will be on-site training when new products are developed, so
        that these
        teams understand how to use and create the products, hosted by Research and Development. Information from all
        meetings
        will be disseminated to all internal stakeholders through memos, as memos offer a secure method of communication
        and are
        accessible to departments like Manufacturing, which may not have consistent access to email (Gerson & Gerson,
        2016, p.
        185). Email will be reserved for quick questions or instant communication between departments to reduce
        unnecessary
        clutter in communication channels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Virtual training sessions, such as those focused on developing or reading product documentation, will be
        conducted using
        platforms like Trainual. Trainual is a versatile training and knowledge management platform that allows the
        creation of
        Standard Operating Procedures and automates training processes, ensuring consistency and scalability in
        training. To
        keep track of these training sessions and assign tasks, a project management platform, like Basecamp, will be
        used to
        ensure accountability across all teams. To improve the new training, BOLDFlash will obtain regular feedback from
        the
        trainees. Using feedback loops, BOLDFlash will gather ongoing input from participants through surveys,
        suggestion boxes,
        and post-training reviews. Feedback loops are vital in fostering ongoing improvement by enabling a cyclical
        exchange of
        information, which helps refine processes to better meet participants’ needs (Trilling, 2024). Using these
        methods,
        BOLDFlash will have a comprehensive and adaptable training approach that addresses the needs of each department
        while
        strengthening inter-departmental communication.
    </p>
    <h3>Framework for Continued Communication</h3>
    <p>
        After the training, to ensure continued communication and collaboration, a structured communication framework
        will be
        implemented. BOLDFlash will first establish clear channels for different types of communication. Monthly
        cross-departmental meetings, as outlined in the training plan, will serve as a way for the departments to meet
        face-to-face and discuss issues. Project Management tools will also continue to be used, while the PMO will take
        responsibility for managing projects on this platform. Email will continue to be reserved for urgent or
        short-form
        communication, while most important communication will happen on the project management platform to ensure
        visibility
        for all important documents. All the meeting summaries and recordings will be saved and stored for future use as
        well.
        A Standard operating Procedure (SOP) will be developed to standardize both the communication channels and
        product
        documentation issues. This SOP will include steps for collaborative review processes, especially for R&D and
        Technical
        Support teams, to ensure product documentation is accurate and user-friendly. The PMO will manage and regularly
        update
        the SOP to reflect evolving business requirements and feedback. Additionally, feedback loops will continue to be
        used
        for continuously improving the training and business processes until we have the Mobile Division running like a
        well-oiled machine. Surveys, post-training reviews, and suggestion boxes will gather input from employees, which
        will be
        analyzed by the PMO. These feedback mechanisms will enable BOLDFlash to identify communication gaps and refine
        processes
        to maintain alignment and effectiveness.
    </p>
    <b>Specified Guidelines</b>
    <p>
        To ensure that the new communication framework is successful, a set of actionable and specific guidelines will
        be
        established. This will provide clear expectations, processes, and responsibilities to the team. Each department
        must use
        designated communication channels for specific purposes. For example, project updates, assignments, and
        discussions
        should happen exclusively within the project management platform. Email is to be reserved for urgent
        communication only,
        reducing clutter and preventing important information from being overlooked. Clear instructions on how to use
        these
        tools will be included in the virtual training and assigned to all employees. When there are meetings, an agenda
        must be
        developed beforehand and distributed to each team at least two business days prior so they can be prepared.
        After each
        meeting, a summary of key decisions and action items will be documented and uploaded to the project management
        platform,
        with clear deadlines and task owners. The PMO will oversee compliance for this process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feedback integration will be another crucial piece of this framework. Feedback loops will be formalized for
        continuous
        improvement in training and collaboration. Surveys will be distributed after training sessions and meetings to
        collect
        input on what worked well and what could be improved. The PMO will review this feedback monthly and use it to
        update
        training materials and refine processes, ensuring that they align with employee needs and organizational goals.
        Additionally, all new documentation must go through the structured review cycle with team meeting to discuss the
        product
        and be walked through parts of the documentation to ensure clarity, technical accuracy, and usability. All
        finalized
        documents will be stored in a centralized location within the project management platform for easy access by
        relevant
        stakeholders. The PMO serves as the central hub for managing cross-departmental projects. They will assign
        dedicated
        contacts for each department to provide support and resolve issues. Each member of the PMO, however, will work
        together
        to ensure all departments are communicating effectively and on the same page. By adhering to these guidelines,
        BOLDFlash
        will establish a robust foundation for communication and collaboration through a structured and collaborative
        approach.
    </p>
    <h3>The Training Critique</h3>
    <b>Target Audience</b>
    <p>The target audience for this memo involves key stakeholders in the Mobile Division, such as Research and
        Development,
        Technical Support, the Sales team, and Manufacturing. Each of these teams plays an important role in ensuring
        the smooth
        operation of product development, distribution, and customer satisfaction. Research and Development plays one of
        the
        most important roles since they are producing the documentation for new products being developed. Their ability
        to
        create clear and concise documentation directly impacts the efficiency of other departments and the overall user
        experience. Technical Support and the Sales have more customer-facing roles. The Technical Support team requires
        detailed but accessible instructions to troubleshoot issues efficiently while the Sales team needs clear,
        concise
        documentation to assist customers when selling their products. Manufacturing, however, needs concise
        documentation to
        ensure they can reproduce the installation document accurately to ensure that it is correctly packaged with each
        product
        before shipping.
    </p>
    <b>Intended Message</b>
    <p>The intended message of this memo is to effectively guide users through the installation and setup process for
        the
        BOLDFlash A23-B flash drive. It is designed to assist users in preparing their new device by creating necessary
        directories, extracting drivers, and ensuring all required files are properly organized. The instructions also
        aim to
        provide a step-by-step process to configure the flash drive correctly and begin using it without unnecessary
        issues. It
        is intended to serve as a refence guide to help users understand the essential prerequisites and installation
        procedures. Furthermore, it is intended to be accessible to users of differing technical backgrounds so that
        even those
        with minimal experience can follow along. However, despite its intended purpose, the current documentation lacks
        clarity
        and structure, making it difficult for users to navigate the installation process effectively.
    </p>
    <b>Critique</b>
    <p>
        There are currently numerous issues within the instructions for the BOLDFlash A23-B flash drive. First, there is
        a lack
        of clarity where the instructions are vague, missing steps, or have ambiguous phrasing. For example, in the
        third
        section of the documentation, it states that you will see a message that says something like “OK to install new
        device
        driver,” but it states “Macs are different” without further elaborating on how they are different and what the
        message
        would look like for those users. Additionally, the formatting of this document is not structured, with a lack of
        headings or clear bullet points for major steps. While there are bullet points in the document, they lack
        clarity for
        exactly what each section entails. This includes the second section titled “Then you should have something like
        this”,
        which is not descriptive and may cause confusion for the user. Furthermore, there are no visual aids that could
        show how
        each step will appear in the user’s system while installing the product. Visual aids play a crucial role in
        technical
        communication by enhancing conciseness, clarity, and visual appeal, making information more accessible and
        engaging for
        readers (Gerson & Gerson, 2016, p. 159).
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the instructions contain overly technical language without explaining what it means for the
        average
        person. In the first step titled “Prerequisites,” the user is told to create a base directory, a subdirectory,
        and to
        download “Irrlicht 1.8.” However, the instructions do not describe what these items are for the average user.
        Many users
        may not know what a base directory or subdirectory is. Additionally, these instructions do not describe the
        purpose of
        installing the drivers. There is also no troubleshooting section or information, which would assist users in
        resolving
        common issues, such as encountering a “device not recognized” error. A troubleshooting section, or additional
        information within each step, would assist both users and Technical Support in resolving these common issues
        more
        effectively. Finally, the steps are out of logical order, making it difficult to follow the installation process
        sequentially. For example, the document instructs users to verify installation only after completing the entire
        setup,
        instead of suggesting an intermediate check after the driver installation phase. This lack of verification can
        lead
        users to complete the process incorrectly before realizing there is an issue. Additionally, the instructions
        require
        users to create directories before explaining why they are necessary, which can be confusing for individuals
        unfamiliar
        with such tasks. The lack of a structured approach in the documentation affects multiple areas, including
        customer
        satisfaction, sales confidence in the product, and technical support team efficiency. This results in increased
        support
        inquiries and a lower overall level of user satisfaction.

    <b>Explanation of New Artifact</b>
    <p>This revised installation guide for the BOLDFlash #A23-B flash drive was enhanced to improve clarity and
        conciseness,
        therefore improving the user experience based on key communication principles. The original product
        documentation was
        overly vague, technical, and lacked appropriate structure which made it difficult for users to follow. The new
        document
        addresses these issues by creating a more logical, step-by-step format with clearly defined sections so that
        users can
        easily locate the information they are looking for. One of the primary enhancements was adding additional
        information to
        each step, which explained why users had to complete certain actions rather than simply listing them. For
        example,
        instead of instructing users to create and extract files, the new instructions clarify the purpose of each
        action, which
        helps users understand the reasoning behind the process. Language was also updated to be more user-friendly with
        less
        technical jargon, which makes the documentation understandable to a broader audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another big change was a troubleshooting section, since the original documentation did not provide any guidance
        for
        users who may encounter issues during the installation of the flash drive. This will help lessen the burden on
        technical
        Support, since we now include a section offering solutions to common problems such as unrecognized devices, slow
        performance, and installation errors. Finally, headings, bullet points, and numbered lists were used to break up
        the
        document into more readable instructions. This allows users to quickly find relevant information without having
        to sift
        through the unorganized bullet points as before. By applying these adaptations, the new installation guide
        aligns with
        the best practices in technical communication, making the setup process more efficient and reducing the
        likelihood of
        user errors. These improvements ultimately enhance the customer experience while minimizing unnecessary
        technical
        support requests, benefiting both users and the Mobile Division at BOLDFlash.
