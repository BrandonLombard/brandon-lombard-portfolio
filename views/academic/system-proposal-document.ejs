    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) are an important element in modern healthcare to enhance communication and
    data management within healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and offices. Despite their benefits, they
    also pose some risks, especially during initial implementation or system upgrades, where workflow changes and lack
    of user familiarity may cause issues or errors. This document examines a case study in which a newly implemented EHR
    system contributed to a diagnostic oversight at an OB/GYN practice. A physician failed to identify a Stage III
    ovarian cancer diagnosis because the scanned lab report was not displayed in a user-friendly manner, leading to
    confusion and critical mistakes. The financial, legal, and patient care consequences of such errors underscore the
    need for a well-structured workflow management system. This proposal outlines the challenges associated with EHR
    adoption, highlights the risks of diagnostic oversight, and presents a systematic approach to improving workflow
    efficiency, reducing errors, and ensuring that healthcare providers can deliver safe and effective patient care.
    </p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>The selected case study displays the consequences of EHR oversight during the implementation of a new system. In
    this case study, an OB/GYN practice missed critical information for a patient in her fifties, whose family had a
    strong history of breast cancer. Her doctor had ordered BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis from the laboratory, where her
    results were scanned into the OB/GYN practice’s EHR system. When the doctor reviewed the lab report, they failed to
    identify critical information for a diagnosis in Stage III ovarian cancer. This is because while reviewing the
    information, they scrolled too far down the page and failed to see the top of the report, where the diagnosis was
    placed. When the provider scrolled towards the bottom of the report, it mistakenly said that no cancer was found,
    which caused confusion for the provider and made it difficult to discern what information was correct. This
    oversight stemmed from both user error and system challenges, due to the practice’s lack of understanding with the
    new EHR system. The financial and legal repercussions for the healthcare provider highlight the need for proper
    planning and execution when implementing EHR systems.</p>
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>The main problem is the diagnostic error caused by oversight and unfamiliarity with the newly implemented EHR
    system, which resulted in poor patient care. This issue stems from a failure to correctly read scanned data,
    accompanied by a lack of system training for staff, and poorly defined protocols for reviewing laboratory results.
    Not only did this issue result in poor patient care, but also legal liability and financial loss for the healthcare
    provider. Without properly addressing these issues, healthcare practices risk further diagnostic errors, increased
    liability, and a reduced level of patient care.</p>
    <h4>Audience</h4>
    <p>The target audience for this proposal includes Healthcare Providers, Administrators, and the EHR Developers. Each
    group has unique roles, responsibilities, and needs that must be addressed throughout the project to ensure its
    success. Healthcare Providers include physicians, nurses, and other front-line medical staff who work directly in
    the EHR system daily. This group requires up-to-date training materials, effective workflows, and clear protocols
    for reviewing patient information. Healthcare Administrators, on the other hand, oversee both operational and
    financial aspects of healthcare facilities. They need to ensure that the EHR system improves efficiency for
    providers while reducing liability risks and complying with healthcare and state regulations. Finally, EHR
    Developers are responsible for designing, implementing, and supporting the EHR system. They require detailed
    feedback on system issues, workflows, and usability of the system.</p>
    <p>To effectively communicate with these key stakeholders, the communication plan must be tailored to each group. For
    the Healthcare Providers, this will include hands-on training sessions where they can learn the workflows and how to
    find the needed data, while also having access to reference guides and documentation on how to use the system.
    Additionally, a group of providers will be selected to regularly review the system to ensure it is functioning
    correctly. Healthcare Administrators will receive regular updates and reports on the system, to include outcomes of
    patient care and feedback from providers. Finally, EHR Developers will be provided with detailed feedback from
    providers and administrators alongside meeting frequently with other key stakeholders to address issues that are
    found. By ensuring each group’s needs and concerns are addressed, the project aims to enhance the success of the EHR
    implementation while minimizing errors that could negatively impact patient care.</p>
    <h3>Systems Requirements</h3>
    <h4>Requirements Modeling</h4>
    <p>To improve the current EHR system with a workflow management system, the requirements have been identified as shown
    below. This system will address key challenges in patient diagnosis management, task tracking, and collecting
    feedback to improve workflow efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure regulation compliance. This new system will
    introduce structured processes to alert providers about critical diagnoses, utilize task management, and streamline
    user feedback. These improvements aim to mitigate the risks of diagnostic oversight and enhance the overall
    effectiveness of the healthcare environment.</p>
    The following <b>Outputs</b> will be used in the system:
    <ul>
    <li>This system must include critical diagnoses alerts, which will generate real-time alerts for critical patient
    diagnoses to notify healthcare providers and management immediately.</li>
    <li>There will be automated notifications that will be sent to providers and management when tasks are assigned to a
    provider.</li>
    <li>Consolidated reports of user feedback for the EHR development team so they can continuously improve the EHR
    system.</li>
    </ul>
    The following <b>Inputs</b> will be used:
    <ul>
    <li>Input fields will be used to capture and update patient diagnosis information accurately after laboratory results
    are submitted.</li>
    <li>Training completion data tracking which training the providers and staff have completed in the workflow management
    system.</li>
    <li>A user feedback form will be utilized so that providers and other staff can input their feedback directly within
    the EHR system.</li>
    </ul>
    The following <b>Process</b> will be used:
    <ul>
    <li>Automatically trigger alerts for critical patient diagnoses, which will notify both the healthcare provider
    working with the patient and the management team.</li>
    The following Performance metrics will be used:
    <li>The system should display important alerts within seconds of receiving the critical diagnosis trigger event.</li>
    <li>The system should be capable of handling inputs from multiple users simultaneously without performance issues.</li>
    <li>The system should ensure a 99.9% up time to support continuous healthcare operations.</li>
    </ul>
    The following <b>Controls (Security)</b> will be used:
    <ul>
    <li>All patient and user data must have encrypted data to comply with HIPPA regulations (Office of the National
    Coordinator for Health Information Technology, n.d.).</li>
    <li>There will be role-based access controls to make sure that only authorized users can access or modify this
    sensitive information</li>
    <li>Detailed logs of all system access and modifications for auditing will be in place.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Business Process Model</h4>
    <p>Business processes play a crucial role in ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and accountability within healthcare
    systems. Below is a business process model diagram that illustrates how the new workflow management system in the
    Electronic Health Records system processes will function to enhance patient safety and reduce diagnostic errors. To
    begin, a lab report will be processed and sent to the workflow management system which will then determine if it is
    a critical diagnosis or not. If it is, the provider will be required to review the findings and determine the
    critical diagnosis. From there, the provider will have 24 hours to review these findings. If they do not review the
    diagnosis, the findings will be reported directly to management who will either follow up with the provider or
    finish the process themselves. If the provider reviews the diagnosis, they will then notify the patient and confirm
    in the system that the patient has been notified. After this process, they will be asked to provide feedback on the
    workflow management system so that the EHR developers can continue to improve the new system.</p>

    <img src="/images/portfolio_projects/academic/system-proposal-document/business-process-model-diagram.png">

    <h4>Data Flow Diagram</h4>
    <p>The process begins with the Lab, which generates a report and stores it in the Reports Database (D1) before sending
    it to the Provider. If the diagnosis is critical, the provider is notified and must review the report (Process 2)
    within 24 hours; otherwise, it is escalated to Management (D2). After reviewing, the provider notifies the patient
    (Process 3) through calls and documentation, with the system recording the details. Finally, the provider submits
    feedback (Process 4), which is stored in the Feedback Database (D3) to support system improvements.</p>

    <i>Data Flow Diagram for the Workflow Management System</i><br>

    <img src="/images/portfolio_projects/academic/system-proposal-document/data-flow-diagram.png">

    <h4>Data Dictionary</h4>
    <p>The data dictionary for the workflow management system requires multiple field names with various data types. The
    data dictionary includes key fields such as lab_report_id, patient_id, and provider_id, which are uniquely assigned
    to each lab report, patient, and provider, respectively. Additionally, fields like critical_status (Boolean)
    determine whether a diagnosis requires urgent attention, while alert_timestamp (DateTime) records when alerts are
    triggered. Other fields, such as review_status and escalation_status, track the review process, ensuring that
    providers address critical diagnoses promptly. Lastly, feedback_provided and feedback_comments store input from
    users, supporting continuous system improvements. By structuring the data elements in a standardized format, the
    data dictionary enhances system reliability, facilitates integration, and ensures compliance with data governance
    policies.</p>

    <h4>Object Modeling</h4>
    <p>The object model for the workflow management system defines key entities and their interactions to ensure efficient
    handling of patient diagnoses and alerts. The Provider object contains attributes such as the Provider ID, Name,
    Phone Number, Role, and Training Status, allowing healthcare professionals to manage patient diagnoses effectively.
    Its methods include Review Diagnosis, Notify Patient, and Submit Feedback, ensuring that critical cases are
    addressed promptly. The Patient object stores Patient ID, Name, Diagnosis, Phone Number, and Email, enabling
    seamless communication and ensuring patients receive timely notifications through the Receive Notification method.
    The Manager object is responsible for overseeing providers and workflow operations, with attributes including
    Manager ID, Name, Email, Phone Number, Role, and Providers Managing. Managers play a crucial role in monitoring
    system activities, as reflected in their methods: Receive Alerts, Monitor Reports, and Notify Patient. This
    object-oriented approach improves system modularity, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring that each entity has
    clearly defined roles and interactions to enhance patient safety and workflow efficiency.</p>

    <h4>Use Case Diagram</h4>
    <p>The Use Case Diagram illustrates the interactions between key actors, such as the Lab, Provider, Manager, Patient,
    and Developers, and the workflow management system. The process begins when the Lab provides a diagnosis, which is
    then checked for critical conditions. If the diagnosis is critical, the system notifies the Provider, who must
    review the diagnosis within 24 hours. If the Provider does not review it in time, an escalation notification is sent
    to the Manager. Once reviewed, the Provider notifies the Patient about their diagnosis. Additionally, the system
    allows the Provider to submit feedback, which is directed to Developers for continuous system improvement. This
    structured workflow ensures timely diagnosis review, accountability, and improved patient safety, reducing the risk
    of missed critical diagnoses.</p>

    <h3>Systems Design</h3>
    <h4>Specifications</h4>
    <p>This system is designed with a scalable web-based architecture hosted on AWS, leveraging an Elastic Load Balancer to
    distribute traffic efficiently across application instances running on AWS EC2. The Node.js/Express backend handles
    business logic, while an OAuth-based authentication service ensures secure access. MongoDB is used for database
    management, supporting high availability and real-time updates for tracking critical patient diagnoses. AWS S3
    provides file storage for records and supporting documents. The system is optimized for both desktop and mobile,
    ensuring accessibility, while real-time updates enhance workflow efficiency for healthcare providers.</p>

    <h4>Data Design</h4>
    <p>The data design process begins with a diagnosis report being produced by the Laboratory, which is then interpreted
    by the Workflow Management System and assigned to the Provider. At this stage, the Provider has several options:
    they can review the diagnosis and notify the patient, escalate the case to management, and optionally provide
    feedback on the system. The Laboratory has a one-to-zero, one, or many relationship with the Diagnosis Report, as a
    single laboratory may generate no reports, a single report, or multiple reports for a patient. Each diagnosis report
    is then assigned to a single Provider. If escalation is necessary, the case may be referred to one or multiple
    managers, depending on the severity of the diagnosis or if a provider does not have time to review the diagnosis
    within 24 hours. When notifying the patient, there is a one-to-one relationship, as each provider corresponds with a
    single patient. Lastly, if the Provider submits feedback on the system, there is a one-to-one or one-to-many
    relationship, as multiple developers on the EHR team may review and act on the feedback.</p>

    User Interface Design
    This application will have a user-friendly interface, since many providers have busy schedules and need an easy and
    efficient interface to navigate. This will be a widget, or data-driven application within the currently existing
    Electronic Health Records system, so providers can have quick and easy access to it. The main dashboard (Figure 9)
    displays all critical diagnoses assigned to a provider, prioritizing urgent cases and offering quick access to
    required actions such as reviewing diagnoses or notifying patients. Upon selecting an action, a popup interface
    provides detailed patient information with interactive checkboxes for reviewing, confirming inconsistencies, and
    notifying the patient, streamlining decision-making (figure 10). The system focuses on usability through minimal
    cognitive load, consistency, error prevention, responsiveness, and accessibility. A help page offers guidance for
    navigation, while a feedback button allows providers to report issues and suggest improvements. The system is
    designed to be intuitive, with a well-organized layout, consistent design elements, and easy navigation to help
    providers complete tasks efficiently.

    System Architecture
    The system architecture of the Workflow Management System is a three-tier model, separating the application into the
    user interface, application server, and data server. Following modern best practices, the system is designed to
    optimize data processing efficiency while maintaining strict security compliance (Rosenblatt, 2016, p. 331). It
    integrates seamlessly with the existing EHR system to enhance accountability among healthcare providers while
    ensuring HIPAA compliance for patient data protection. The cloud-based infrastructure, hosted on AWS, provides
    scalability and cost-efficiency, reducing the need for on-premise servers. Role-based access control ensures that
    only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. The system employs RESTful APIs to interface with EHR
    databases, laboratory information management systems (LIMS), and provider management tools, ensuring real-time
    updates and seamless data exchange. Automated audit logs track all modifications for compliance and accountability.
    With a responsive web interface developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system is accessible across both desktop
    and mobile devices, enabling providers to efficiently manage critical diagnoses, escalate cases when necessary, and
    ensure timely patient notifications without disrupting workflows
    Feasibility Analysis
    The proposed Workflow Management System presents a highly feasible solution to address the critical issue of missed
    diagnoses in the current Electronic Health Records system. From an operational standpoint, this system enhances
    efficiency by introducing structured workflows that ensure all critical diagnoses are reviewed and acted upon in a
    timely manner. This mitigates the risk of oversight, as seen in the case of a patient whose breast cancer diagnosis
    was overlooked due to the inefficiencies in the current system. By automating notifications, tracking response
    times, and escalating unreviewed cases to management, the system ensures accountability and improves patient
    outcomes. Since this application directly ties into the current EHR, it makes it easy to implement and use for
    providers and management. Additionally, it leverages modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js,
    and MongoDB, ensuring scalability and reliability while role-based access control and encryption maintain HIPAA
    compliance, securing patient data. The use of RESTful APIs allows smooth interoperability with laboratory systems
    and provider dashboards, ensuring a real-time, automated workflow for managing critical diagnoses. This system will
    be designed with horizontal scalability, which allows it to handle increasing users by distributing traffic across
    multiple servers.
    From a cost perspective, the initial expenses will primarily be for developing the system, ensuring security
    compliance measures, and for staff training. Using AWS (Cloud-based infrastructure) will provide a cost-effective
    solution by allowing dynamic resource allocation depending on user traffic on the application. Long-term maintenance
    costs will include system updates, security patches, and support services, all which can be mitigated by using
    open-source libraries and software development best practices. Additionally, the reduction in malpractice risks and
    legal liabilities due to missed diagnoses further contributes to the system’s financial viability by potentially
    lowering insurance premiums and legal expenses for healthcare organizations. The implementation timeline will be in
    phases to minimize disruptions to current healthcare operations. In the initial phase, we will focus on developing
    the dashboard and correctly retrieving information from the laboratory’s reports. The second phase will focus on
    integrating the critical diagnosis alerts and escalation workflows into the dashboard. Finally, the last phase will
    include the development in user feedback mechanisms. Each phase will include User Acceptance Testing, where selected
    providers and staff will test the system for its workflow capability and for issues. Overall, this Workflow
    Management System is a scalable, cost-effective, and essential improvement that directly addresses the current gaps
    in patient diagnosis management while ensuring compliance, efficiency, and long-term adaptability.
    Project Plan
    Work Breakdown Structure
    To implement a workflow management system, there must be a collaborative effort between EHR developers, the system
    analyst, administrators, and providers. First, the EHR developers and the system analyst will be involved in
    planning the design and architecture of the workflow management system. The developers will also be directly
    involved in creating the custom forms and widgets, alongside the alert system implementation for this system after a
    plan has been established. Not only this, but they will need to perform ongoing maintenance and updates to this
    system, while ensuring security and compliance with HIPPA. Administrators, on the other hand, will have a direct
    impact on how smoothly the system is implemented. They will oversee system development and manage project timelines
    while being directly involved in stakeholder communication. They will also coordinate training of the new system and
    ensure that the system adheres to regulatory standards and hospital policies. Finally, the providers will be
    directly involved in testing the new system before implementation and providing feedback after implementation if any
    issues arise or workflows could be improved.
    Project Monitoring and Control Plan
    Monitoring this project and having an efficient control plan is important in ensuring the success of this new
    implementation. This plan includes project tracking, quality assurance, risk management, and change control
    strategies. Project progress will be tracked with Jira, which is a common project management tool that can organize
    tasks into sprints, assign specific tasks, log bug fixes, and track progress of a project. Additionally, we will
    have weekly standup meetings between the administrators, the system analyst, and EHR developers to ensure the team
    is on the same page. These meetings will align with the Agile methodology, which emphasizes frequent communication,
    iterative development, and adaptability to project needs (Tilley & Rosenblatt, 2016, p. 22). Furthermore, quality
    assurance and testing will be frequently used between the providers, administrators, and EHR developers. This will
    include developers creating unit tests to verify individual components of the workflow management system,
    administrators performing workflow testing to ensure seamless integration within the EHR, and providers conducting
    user acceptance testing (UAT) to confirm that the system meets clinical needs. Security testing will also be
    conducted to verify compliance with HIPAA regulations and data protection policies. Any issues identified during
    testing will be logged as Jira tickets and prioritized for resolution.
    To mitigate risks, a risk management strategy will be put in place as well. These risks can range from system
    integration failure, provider resistance to adopting the new system, security issues, and workflow inefficiencies.
    To address this, there will be pre-implementation pilot testing, comprehensive provider training, and weekly
    security audits. Risk mitigation measures will also be documented and reviewed during weekly standup meetings.
    Finally, there will be change control strategies to make sure future system updates are managed correctly. Any
    modifications or issues must be submitted through Jira, which will then be reviewed then either approved or denied
    by the administrators. Then, if approved, they will schedule these updates for upcoming sprints. This structured
    approach will allow for continuous development and improvements while minimizing disruptions in the existing
    workflow and EHR system.
    Timeline
    This timeline will consist of 5 phases: Planning, System Design and Architecture, Development, Integration and
    Testing, and Training and Deployment. This project will span approximately 18 weeks, beginning with a week-long
    planning phase, where project scope, responsibilities, and scope will be defined. Then, there will be a System
    Design and Architecture phase, where the focus will be on analyzing the current HER system and designing the new
    workflow management system so that the Development phase will go smoothly. Next, in development, the EHR team will
    build the custom form, task management features, feedback reporting, and the critical findings alert system. Once
    development is complete, it will be the Integration and Testing phase, where the developers, providers, and
    administrators will work together to test the system and make sure it functions as designed. Finally, in the
    Training and Deployment phase, all staff will be trained in the new system, and there will be a pilot launch session
    where further feedback will be gathered. From here, the development team will make the necessary adjustments before
    the system goes live. Refer to Figure 1 below for more information.

    Conclusion
    Implementing this Workflow Management System within the existing Electronic Health Records System is important in
    reducing diagnostic errors, increasing provider efficiency, and improving patient safety. This System Proposal
    Document addresses the critical issue of missed diagnoses because of oversight and lack of user familiarity in the
    current system, as demonstrated in the OB/GYN case study. By using structured alerts and task management alongside
    provider feedback mechanisms, this proposed system ensures that that critical diagnoses are reviewed in a timely
    manner and that healthcare providers are better equipped to manage patient information accurately. The proposed
    solution balances technical feasibility, regulatory compliance, and user-centered design, leveraging modern web
    technologies and cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and reliability. With a detailed implementation plan
    that includes stakeholder training, risk mitigation strategies, and iterative testing, this system can be seamlessly
    integrated into existing EHR environments. By prioritizing user experience, accountability, and patient care, this
    Workflow Management System has the potential to significantly enhance healthcare operations, reduce liability risks,
    and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
